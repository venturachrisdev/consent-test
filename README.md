## Consents app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The goal of this challenge is to build the simplest possible consent collection and management application where a user can enter its information and agree to a list of data processing.

## Folder Structure

```
consent-test/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    components/
    core/
      entities/
      utils/
    ducks/
    screens/
    store/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`
Install all the dependencies required to run this project.

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
